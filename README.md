# Function Generator

## About

This repository contains embedded software for a function generator implemented on the TMS320F28069M microcontroller. The function generator is capable of generating three-phase wave with configurable parameters such as: frequency of PWM and sin wave, modulation depth, offset, and phase (of each wave).

### Built With

IDE: Code Composer Studio v12
Compiler: TI v22.6.1 LTS
HTerm 0.8.9

## Target

Microcontroller: Texas Instruments TMS320F28069M

### Program logic explained 
The PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) logic creates the waveform by generating a sinusoidal signal modulated by a triangular carrier signal. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how this logic works:
1. Basic PWM Setup
A higher PWM frequency means the ISR is triggered more frequently, allowing for more updates to the PWM duty cycle, which can improve accuracy and resolution of the output signal.
Adjusting the sin frequency changes the rate at which the angle increments in the ISR. A higher sin frequency results in faster angle increments, which increases the frequency of the generated sinusoidal waveform.

  PWM frequency: Determines the size of the pwm timer, the smallest value is 687 because the pwm counter is only 16 bits, 65535 > 90*10^6 / (PWM_FREQUENCY*2) .
  Timer period (TBPRD): Calculated based on the system clock and the desired PWM frequency. The value of TBPRD sets the period of the triangle waveform that is used to modulate the duty cycle.
   
3. Sinusoidal Signal Generation
  Angle Calculation: An angle is incremented in each ISR call to simulate the sinusoidal waveform.
  Angle Increment (angleincrement): This value determines how fast the angle progresses based on the sinusoidal frequency.
    float angleincrement = 2 * M_PI / (originalePwmParams.pwm_frequency / originalePwmParams.sin_frequency);
  Wrap-around Logic: If the angle exceeds 2 * M_PI, it wraps around to keep it within the range of 0 to 2 * M_PI.

4. Duty Cycle Calculation
   Sine Calculation: The sine of the current angle, adjusted by a phase shift (angle_1, angle_2, angle_3), is used to create a sinusoidal modulation.
    float duty_cycle = (sinf(angle + originalePwmParams.angle_1 * M_PI / 180.0) * originalePwmParams.modulation_depth + 1) * 0.5 - originalePwmParams.offset;

Changing pwm freq changes what the pwm counter counts to (larger pwm freq = Smaller pwm count = more values = better resolution),
